= General advice
- If the question gives you an approximation, use it!
- Read the question carefully and think about what solution you want to obtain before starting complicated maths.

= Thermal physics
- It is usually easier to use $F$ than $U$ for finding quantities like the equation of state, magnetic dipole moment, etc.
- $p = 2 u \/ 3$ for #emph[any] non-relativistic gas.
- Don't forget to divide by $N !$ for the partition function of a gas whose particles are indistinguishable.
- Don't forget the chemical potential term in the energy of a gas in an open system:
$ U = - dv(, beta) ln cal(Z) + mu N text(".") $

= Electromagnetism
- The magnetic field outside an object is not just the external field. Remember that the object changes the field as well.
- When finding the power transmission coefficient, compare the magnitudes of the Poynting vectors.

= Quantum mechanics
- Don't forget to square when normalising a state, and don't forget to normalise in the first place.
- $0 dot 1$ is not $1$ (for example, in $j(j+1)$).
- Don't forget how to take the determinant of a $3 times 3$ matrix:
$ mat(delim: "|", a, b, c; d, e, f; g, h, i)
= a mat(delim: "|", e, f; h, i)
- b mat(delim: "|", d, f; g, i)
+ c mat(delim: "|", d, e; g, h) text(".") $

- Don't get the signs the wrong way round for perturbation theory. The signs in the denominator are always such that the second-order correction to the ground state energy is non-positive, and the order in the numerator is the other way round.
  That is,
$ ket(delta psi_0^((1))) &= sum_(n=1)^infinity braket(n, hat(H), 0)/(E_0 - E_n) ket(n) text(",") \
delta E_0^((2)) &= sum_(n=1)^infinity (lr(|braket(n, hat(H), 0)|)^2)/(E_0-E_n) <= 0 text(".") $

- Don't forget the $1\/2m$ factor in the Hamiltonian. It should be $-hbar^2\/2m$.
- $Delta x Delta p$ is not $<=hbar\/2$.
$ Delta x Delta p >= hbar /2 text(".") $

- The ground state is not zero energy.
- For spin-symmetric fermions, the fact that $ket(00)$ doesn't exist doesn't mean that there is no ground state.
  Instead, the ground state is $ket(01)$ or $ket(10)$.
- Remember the time dependence in the Heisenberg equation of motion:
$ dv(hat(Q), t) = 1/(upright(i)hbar) [hat(Q), hat(H)] + pdv(hat(Q), t) text(".") $

= Miscellaneous
- $upright(e)^0 = 1$, not $0$.
- In spherical coordinates, the contributors to the Jacobian are $1$ for $dd(r)$, $r$ for $dd(theta)$, and $r sin theta$ for $dd(phi)$.
- In spherical coordinates, the divergence is not $pdv(vectorbold(F), r)$:
$ div vectorbold(F) = 1/(r^2) pdv((r^2 F_r), r) + dots text("(just use the Data Sheetâ„¢, it's easier).") $
