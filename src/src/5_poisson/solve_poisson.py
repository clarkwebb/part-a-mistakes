    This function solves Poisson's equation using the over-relaxation method

    Inputs:
    * init_psi: 2D matrix containing the initial psi, including boundaries
    * fixed_psi: 2D matrix representing all values of psi that will stay
        constant throughout the iterations (1 if they stay constant and 0
        otherwise)
    * source: the inhomogeneity in Poisson's equation
        (the "f" in del^2 psi = f)

    Outputs:
    * psi: 2D matrix of the value of psi after the solution

    Constraints:
    * alpha and the number of iterations must be determined by the function
    * init_psi, fixed_psi, and source are assumed to have the same size and
        the function does not need to check this
